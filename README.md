This is my first Full Stack Frameworks with Django Project submitted in completion of the Code Institute’s Diploma in Software Development.

The project was developed based on the View-Model-Controller architecture with multiple apps according to the usability of each part of the web application.

The focus of Tag Albums is to provide a website able to categorize photos according to labels provided by the user. A single album can be created by just uploading photos and labeling them.

Users can register and create an account to save their photos and albums.

# USER EXPERIENCE - UX



## Main Goals

  The users for this web-page would be people who love photos and make albums. When navigating through the website, users will be able to:
  
  - Upload photos and create albums.
  - Organize photos according to categories created by them.
  - Tag and “un-tag” photos.
  - Save different albums.
  
  The site owner will have the opportunity to receive donations made by the users who are willing to help with the website or just want to get rid of add pop ups.


## User Stories

  ### User Authentication
  - As a user, I would like to log in and log out, so that I can access my photos from any device;
  - As a user, I would like to recover my password in case I forget it, so that I can recover access to my account;

## Design

  ### Colours

  - The main background colour throughout the website is Eire Black, intentionally to contrast colorful photos;
  - Photos wrappers are plain white, resembling printed photos borders;
  - Fonts throughthout the website is grey also to help to highlight photos;
  - Alert messages for errors in forms have their font colour dark red, a nice touch over the background.


  ### Typography
   - The font chosen for this web site was Open Sans, also for its simplicity and well aceptance.

# FEATURES

This project is made by the main app "tag_albums" and also by more four apps: "Home", "Profiles", "Photos" and "Subscription".


  ## Landing page
  - The landing page is already interactive, it has a blinking tab which tempts the user to already starting tagging, which is the main goal of the page
  - Each time that the user writes and press enter, a new tag is created and is placed in one of the original tags;
  - It has a loop that after the third time, the new tag replaces the first one.
    
  ## Anonymous Users
  - Anonymous users cannot save photos uploaded. They are cached in the session instead;
  - Each time that the home page is accessed, all the photos uploaded and their tags are deleted.
  
  ## Add popup
  - A add pops in the screen every 15 seconds after the last upload;
  - The add pop up advises the users that are logged into their account and donation placed with the same email will not see the pop up again.

 ## DATA ARCHITECTURE
  
  To store data in the development level, the database SQlite3 was installed when app was created with Django, while for production the website uses PostgreSQL (add-on provided by Heroku)
  
  
## Data Modeling

### Authentication Model

Users can create their account using authorization form created by django.
The model was instaled by typing the following commands in the terminal

      pip3 install django-allauth
      
      cp -r ../.pip-modules/lib/python3.8/site-packages/allauth/templates/* ./templates/allauth/


It is also necessary to add AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS in settings in the main app

      AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = [
    ...
    # Needed to login by username in Django admin, regardless of `allauth`
    'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend',

    # `allauth` specific authentication methods, such as login by e-mail
    'allauth.account.auth_backends.AuthenticationBackend',
    ...
    ]

The complete guide to install all_auth can be found [here](https://django-allauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)


### Profiles App

#### UserProfile Model

| Name | Key | Field Type | Validation |
| --- | ----------- |-----|---- |
| User | user | OneToOneField (User) | on_delete=models.CASCADE |
| Nickname | display_name | CharField | max_length=20, null=True, blank=True |

UserProfile is created as via signals once a new account is set up. Nickname is set with the same username, this field can be edited by users once they access their account.
 
 
### Subsbscription App

#### Tiers Model

| Name | Key | Field Type | Validation |
| --- | ----------- |-----|---- |
| User | user | ForeignKey (UserProfile) | on_delete=models.SET_NULL,null=True, blank=True, related_name='tier' |
| Tier | tier | BooleanField | default=False |

Tiers are created as via signals once a new UserProfile is set up. Tier has default set to False and it is set to True once the same email used to create to open the account is also linked to a donation made by the user. When Tier is set to True, users will no longer see popup add.

#### Snack Model

| Name | Key | Field Type | Validation |
| --- | ----------- |-----|---- |
| First Name | f_name |CharField | max_length=50, null=False, blank=False|
| Last Name | l_name | CharField|max_length=50, null=True, blank=True|
| Email | email| EmailField| max_length=254, null=False, blank=False|
| Street Address 1 | street_address1|CharField | max_length=80, null=False, blank=False|
| Street Address 2 | street_address2|CharField | max_length=80, null=True, blank=True|
| Town or City | town_or_city| CharField| max_length=40, null=False, blank=False|
| County | county| CharField| max_length=80, null=True, blank=True|
| Postal Code | postcode|CharField | max_length=20, null=True, blank=True|
| Country | country|CountryField | blank_label='Country', null=False, blank=False, default='Country'|
| Date | date| DateTimeField| auto_now_add=True|
| Snack Quantity | sanck_qty| IntegerField| null=False, default=0|
| Total | total| IntegerField| null=False, default=0|
| Snack Data | snack_data | TextField| null=True, blank=True, default=''|
| Stripe PID | stripe_pid | CharField| max_length=254, null=True, blank=True, default='|


Snack data is created when the user decides to donate to the page. It is symbolically called "buy me a snack". Fields required are **First Name** , **Email**, **Street Address 1**, **Town or City**, **Country**, **Snack Quantity** and **Total** (These last two fields are set a page before the user is redirected to the payment screen)

Once the payment is processed, webhook handles the data to prevent payment being made without data being saved. Snack Data field is created with the quantity and total previously selected and Stripe PID is also saved in order to guarantee that the user will not donate and have this information lost.


### Photos App

#### Photos Model

| Name | Key | Field Type | Validation |
| --- | ----------- |-----|---- |
| Photo Owner | owner | ForeignKey (UserProfile) |on_delete=models.SET_NULL,null=True, blank=True, related_name='photos'|
| Upload Date | upload_date | DateTimeField | N/A |
| Uploaded Photo | image | FileField | null=False, blank=False |

Login is required to upload photos. FileField is set as image in html unput, the idea is to let users to update videos in future versions of this project, also based on their Tiers. Upload Date was not set to auto_date and data is generated when form is submited (this is not the best practice, this was the first model created in the project and modification in this field was left to future improvement due to time constraints)

#### Tags Model

| Name | Key | Field Type | Validation |
| --- | ----------- |-----|---- |
| Tag Name | tag_name | CharField | max_length=100, null=True, blank=True |
| Tag Photos | tag_photos | ManyToManyField (Photos) | Photos |

Tags are created when users edit photos. Before form is submited, the site look for duplicates and only unique tags are stored. Each Tag Name can be linked to many Photos, as well as many Photos can be linked to Many tags. The relationship is set after Tag Names are added to the model.
